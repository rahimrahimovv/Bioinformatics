🧬 Putative Disease Gene Identification and Drug Repurposing for Obesity
Overview
This study investigates multiple methodologies to analyze protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and their significance in disease-gene associations, specifically targeting Obesity.

Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and is often associated with significant metabolic dysregulation – including insulin resistance, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. This project’s objective was to identify the most effective algorithm for accurately extracting genes linked to obesity-related pathways.

Methodologies
The algorithms evaluated included:

DIAMOnD 💎 (Disease Module Detection)
DiaBLE 🧩
Heat Diffusion Approach 🔥
Evaluation Process
Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score. Results indicated that DiaBLE, combined with enrichment analysis, provided the most robust gene identification.

Additionally, drug repurposing was explored to identify existing drugs that could target specific genes implicated in obesity, potentially offering new therapeutic options.
