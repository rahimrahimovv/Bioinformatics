# Putative disease gene identification and drug repurposing for Obesity 
In this study, I investigated multiple methodologies to analyze protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and their significance in disease-gene associations, specifically targeting Obesity.
Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and often associated with significant metabolic dysregulation, including insulin resistance, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. The objective was to identify the most effective algorithm for accurately extracting genes linked to obesity-related pathways. The algorithms evaluated included DIAMOnD (for disease module detection), DiaBLE, and a heat diffusion approach. Comparative performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Results indicate that DiaBLE and enrichment analysis provided the most robust gene identification. Additionally, drug repurposing was explored to identify existing drugs that could target the specific genes implicated in obesity, potentially offering new therapeutic options.
